# Introduction {#intro}

Over the course of the last year, I have developed an algorithm that calculates 
the expected outcome for security^[1](#def)^ derivatives^[2](#def)^. In this 
paper, I am specifically referring to put options^[3](#def)^ and call 
options^[4](#def)^ on stocks when I reference security derivatives. To do this, 
I calculate several probabilities^[4](#def)^ and find the expected gain or cost, 
then combine them to calculate the expected value^[5](#def)^ and understand if 
it is worthwhile to purchase. 

These probabilities are bootstrapped^[6](#def)^ through the use of a Monte Carlo 
simulation^[7](#def)^. 

Finally, I am using this simulation across a variety of stocks to understand 
which options for which stock have the highest expected values. With the details 
from the Monte Carlo simulation, however, there are a number of different values 
created that can be used to create a winning strategy.

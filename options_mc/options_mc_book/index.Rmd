# Introduction

Over the course of the last year, I've developed a Monte Carlo simulation that 
will predict the potential outcomes of a security ($s$) over the next $n$ days. With 
this simulation, I can predict the likelihood ($P_{as}$) a security goes above 
(below) its derivative's strike price, $S_p$. With this simulation, I can also 
evaluate the expected value, $E(s | s > S_p)$, of a security above (below) its 
strike price, $S_p$. With this information, I can calculate the overall 
expected value, $E(d)$, of buying different derivatives. This allows for building 
the best purchases.

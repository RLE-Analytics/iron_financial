# Introduction

Over the course of the last year, I have developed an algorithm that calculates 
the expected outcome for security^[In finance, a security refers to 
a tradable financial asset that has monetary value and can be bought or sold in 
a financial market. Securities include a wide range of assets, such as stocks, 
bonds, options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), among others.] 
derivatives^[A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from 
the value of an underlying security, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency. 
<br><br>In other words, the value of a derivative depends on the value of the 
underlying asset. There are many types of derivatives, including options, 
futures, forwards, and swaps.<br><br>For example, an option is a type of 
derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or 
sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a specified time period.]. 
In this paper, I am specifically 
referring to put options^[A put option is a type of financial contract that 
gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to _sell_ an underlying 
security at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific 
period of time (known as the strike date).<br><br>In other words, a put option 
gives the holder the ability to sell an asset at a certain price, even if the market 
price of the asset falls below the strike price. This can be useful for 
investors who believe that the price of an asset is likely to decline, as it 
allows them to profit from the decline without actually owning the asset.<br><br>
For example, if an investor buys a put option for a certain stock with a strike 
price of \$50 and an expiration date of one month, and the stock's market price 
falls to \$40 during that time, the investor can exercise the put option to sell 
the stock at the higher strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share. 
However, if the stock's market price remains above the strike price of 
\$50, the investor may choose not to exercise the put option and will lose the 
premium paid to purchase the option.] and call options^[A call option is a type 
of financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, 
to _buy_ an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, at a 
predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific period of 
time.<br><br>In other words, a call option gives the holder the ability to 
purchase an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of the asset 
rises above the strike price. This can be useful for investors who believe that 
the price of an asset is likely to increase, as it allows them to profit from 
the increase without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example, if an 
investor buys a call option for a certain stock with a strike price of \$50 and 
an expiration date of one month, and the stock's market price rises to \$60 
during that time, the investor can exercise the call option to buy the stock at 
the lower strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share.<br><br>
However, if the stock's market price remains below the strike price of \$50, the 
investor may choose not to exercise the call option and will lose the premium 
paid to purchase the option.] when I reference derivatives. To do this, I 
calculate several probabilities^[Probability is a measure of the likelihood or 
chance that a specific event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
<br><br>A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while a 
probability of 1 means that the event is certain to occur. A probability of 
0.5 (or 50%) means that the event has an equal chance of occurring or not 
occurring.] and expected values, then combine them to 
understand if it is worthwhile to purchase a security derivative. 

These probabilities are [bootstrapped](#link-to-bootstrap) through the use of a 
[Monte Carlo simulation](#link-to-mc). I am first simulating the price of the 
security on the strike date. I am then able, with this information, to obtain 
the probability the security will be above or below a certain strike and the 
expected value of the security if it does go above (below) the strike for a call 
(put). Combining this with the cost to purchase that derivative, I am able to 
create an expected value for a range of security derivatives.

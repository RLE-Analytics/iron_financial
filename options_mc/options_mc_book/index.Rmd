# Introduction {#intro}

Over the past year, I've revolutionized the world of security^[1](#def)^ 
derivatives^[2](#def)^ by developing an algorithm that calculates expected 
outcomes with accuracy. Specifically, I've focused on the lucrative world of 
put^[3](#def)^ and call options^[4](#def)^ on stocks - and I'm thrilled to share 
my approach findings with you.

Using a cutting-edge Monte Carlo simulation^[5](#def)^, I've created a range of 
probabilities^[6](#def)^ that accurately reflect the expected gains and costs of 
each option. By combining these probabilities, I've unlocked the secret to 
calculating expected value^[7](#def)^ with incredible accuracy - making it 
easier than ever to decide which options to purchase and when.

In fact, I've already put my algorithm to the test with a variety of different 
stocks - and the results are nothing short of astounding. With a winning 
strategy in hand, you'll be able to confidently navigate the complex world of 
security derivatives - and come out on top every time. So buckle up, and get 
ready to join me on the forefront of financial innovation.

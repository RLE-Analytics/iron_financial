1. In finance, a security refers to a tradable financial asset that has monetary 
value and can be bought or sold in a financial market. Securities include a wide 
range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, options, futures, and exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs), among others.[↩︎](#intro)

2. A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from the value 
of an underlying security, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency.<br>
<br>In other words, the value of a derivative depends on the value of the underlying 
asset. There are many types of derivatives, including options, futures, 
forwards, and swaps.<br><br>For example, an option is a type of derivative that 
gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying 
asset at a specific price within a specified time period.[↩︎](#intro)

3. A put option is a type of financial contract that gives the holder the right, 
but not the obligation, to sell an underlying security at a predetermined price 
(known as the strike price) within a specific period of time (known as the 
strike date).<br><br>In other words, a put option gives the holder the ability 
to sell an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of the asset falls 
below the strike price. This can be useful for investors who believe that the 
price of an asset is likely to decline, as it allows them to profit from the 
decline without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example, if an investor 
buys a put option for a certain stock with a strike price of \$50 and an 
expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price falls to \$40 during 
that time, the investor can exercise the put option to sell the stock at the 
higher strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share. However, if the 
stock’s market price remains above the strike price of \$50, the investor may 
choose not to exercise the put option and will lose the premium paid to purchase 
the option.[↩︎](#intro)

4. A call option is a type of financial contract that gives the holder the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset, such as a stock, 
bond, or commodity, at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within 
a specific period of time.<br><br>In other words, a call option gives the holder 
the ability to purchase an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of 
the asset rises above the strike price. This can be useful for investors who 
believe that the price of an asset is likely to increase, as it allows them to 
profit from the increase without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example, 
if an investor buys a call option for a certain stock with a strike price of 
\$50 and an expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price rises to 
\$60 during that time, the investor can exercise the call option to buy the 
stock at the lower strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share.<br>
<br>However, if the stock’s market price remains below the strike price of \$50, 
the investor may choose not to exercise the call option and will lose the 
premium paid to purchase the option.[↩︎](#intro)

5. A Monte Carlo simulation is a computational method used to estimate the 
probability distribution of an outcome by generating a large number of random 
samples or scenarios and analyzing their aggregate behavior.[↩︎](#intro)

6. Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance that a specific event 
will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.<br><br>A probability of 0 
means that the event is impossible, while a probability of 1 means that the 
event is certain to occur. A probability of 0.5 (or 50%) means that the event 
has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.[↩︎](#intro)

7. Expected value is a concept used in statistics to calculate the long-term 
average value of a random variable, taking into account the probability of each 
possible outcome.<br><br>The expected value is calculated by multiplying each 
possible outcome by its probability and adding up all the products. In other 
words, it is the weighted average of all possible outcomes.[↩︎](#intro)

# Calculating an Option's Expected Value

The expected value for each option can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
E_p(k) = (P_{ae} * C) + (P_{be} * G)
(\#eq:puts)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
E_c(k) = (P_{be} * C) + (P_{ae} * G)
(\#eq:calls)
\end{equation} 

where  

- $E_p(k)$ is the expected value of a put at strike price $k$
- $E_c(k)$ is the expected value of a call at strike price $k$
- $P_{ae}$ is the probability a security price on the strike date is above the 
_effective price_^[The effective price is the strike price plus the option cost 
(for calls) - you cannot make money on the option until you cross this 
threshold], $k_e$
    - This is calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation
    - $P_{ae} = \frac{r_{ae}}{r_t}$ where $r_{ae}$ is the number of runs above 
    the expected price and $r_t$ are the total runs
- $P_{be}$ = 1 - $P_{ae}$ is the probability a security price on the strike date 
is below the _effective price_, $k_e$
- $C = 100c$ is the cost to buy the option
    - $c$ is the cost of a single option (options are typically bought/sold in 
    lots of 100)
- $G = 100(E_{p_s}(p_s|p_s>k_e) - c)$ is the expected gain if the derivative 
is in the money 
    - $E_{p_s}(p_s|p_s>k_e)$ is the expected value of the of the price of the 
    stock, $p_s$, given that the price of the stock has exceeded the effective 
    price, $k_e$ (for calls).

<li><p>In finance, a security refers to a tradable financial asset that has monetary
value and can be bought or sold in a financial market. Securities include a wide
range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, options, futures, and exchange-traded
funds (ETFs), among others.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from the value
of an underlying security, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency.<br>
<br>In other words, the value of a derivative depends on the value of the underlying
asset. There are many types of derivatives, including options, futures,
forwards, and swaps.<br><br>For example, an option is a type of derivative that
gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying
asset at a specific price within a specified time period.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>A put option is a type of financial contract that gives the holder the right,
but not the obligation, to sell an underlying security at a predetermined price
(known as the strike price) within a specific period of time (known as the
strike date).<br><br>In other words, a put option gives the holder the ability
to sell an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of the asset falls
below the strike price. This can be useful for investors who believe that the
price of an asset is likely to decline, as it allows them to profit from the
decline without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example, if an investor
buys a put option for a certain stock with a strike price of $50 and an
expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price falls to $40 during
that time, the investor can exercise the put option to sell the stock at the
higher strike price of $50, making a profit of $10 per share. However, if the
stock’s market price remains above the strike price of $50, the investor may
choose not to exercise the put option and will lose the premium paid to purchase
the option.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>A call option is a type of financial contract that gives the holder the
right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset, such as a stock,
bond, or commodity, at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within
a specific period of time.<br><br>In other words, a call option gives the holder
the ability to purchase an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of
the asset rises above the strike price. This can be useful for investors who
believe that the price of an asset is likely to increase, as it allows them to
profit from the increase without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example,
if an investor buys a call option for a certain stock with a strike price of
$50 and an expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price rises to
$60 during that time, the investor can exercise the call option to buy the
stock at the lower strike price of $50, making a profit of $10 per share.<br>
<br>However, if the stock’s market price remains below the strike price of $50,
the investor may choose not to exercise the call option and will lose the
premium paid to purchase the option.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance that a specific event
will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.<br><br>A probability of 0
means that the event is impossible, while a probability of 1 means that the
event is certain to occur. A probability of 0.5 (or 50%) means that the event
has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>Expected value is a concept used in statistics to calculate the long-term
average value of a random variable, taking into account the probability of each
possible outcome.<br><br>The expected value is calculated by multiplying each
possible outcome by its probability and adding up all the products. In other
words, it is the weighted average of all possible outcomes.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>A bootstrap sample is a sample of data that is created by randomly selecting
observations with replacement from a larger data set. The term “bootstrap” comes
from the idea of pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps, as the bootstrap method
allows us to estimate the properties of a population by repeatedly resampling
from a smaller sample.<br><br>To create a bootstrap sample, we start by randomly
selecting an observation from the original data set and adding it to the new
sample. We then put the observation back in the original data set and repeat
this process, selecting a new observation with replacement each time, until we
have a sample of the desired size. By selecting with replacement, some
observations may be selected more than once, while others may not be selected at
all.<br><br>Bootstrap sampling is commonly used in statistics to estimate the
sampling distribution of a statistic, such as the mean or variance, when the
underlying population distribution is unknown or difficult to model. By
repeatedly resampling from the available data, we can generate many different
bootstrap samples and use them to estimate the variability and uncertainty of
the statistic of interest.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li><p>A Monte Carlo simulation is a computational method used to estimate the
probability distribution of an outcome by generating a large number of random
samples or scenarios and analyzing their aggregate behavior.<a href="#intro">↩︎</a></p></li>

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Over the course of the last year, I have developed an algorithm that calculates
the expected outcome for security\footnote{In finance, a security refers to
  a tradable financial asset that has monetary value and can be bought or sold in
  a financial market. Securities include a wide range of assets, such as stocks,
  bonds, options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), among others.}
derivatives\footnote{A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from
  the value of an underlying security, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency.
  In other words, the value of a derivative depends on the value of the
  underlying asset. There are many types of derivatives, including options,
  futures, forwards, and swaps.For example, an option is a type of
  derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
  sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a specified time period.}.
In this paper, I am specifically
referring to put options\footnote{A put option is a type of financial contract that
  gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to \emph{sell} an underlying
  security at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific
  period of time (known as the strike date).In other words, a put option
  gives the holder the ability to sell an asset at a certain price, even if the market
  price of the asset falls below the strike price. This can be useful for
  investors who believe that the price of an asset is likely to decline, as it
  allows them to profit from the decline without actually owning the asset.
  For example, if an investor buys a put option for a certain stock with a strike
  price of \$50 and an expiration date of one month, and the stock's market price
  falls to \$40 during that time, the investor can exercise the put option to sell
  the stock at the higher strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share.
  However, if the stock's market price remains above the strike price of
  \$50, the investor may choose not to exercise the put option and will lose the
  premium paid to purchase the option.} and call options\footnote{A call option is a type
  of financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
  to \emph{buy} an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, at a
  predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific period of
  time.In other words, a call option gives the holder the ability to
  purchase an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of the asset
  rises above the strike price. This can be useful for investors who believe that
  the price of an asset is likely to increase, as it allows them to profit from
  the increase without actually owning the asset.For example, if an
  investor buys a call option for a certain stock with a strike price of \$50 and
  an expiration date of one month, and the stock's market price rises to \$60
  during that time, the investor can exercise the call option to buy the stock at
  the lower strike price of \$50, making a profit of \$10 per share.
  However, if the stock's market price remains below the strike price of \$50, the
  investor may choose not to exercise the call option and will lose the premium
  paid to purchase the option.} on stocks when I reference security derivatives.
To do this, I
calculate several probabilities\footnote{Probability is a measure of the likelihood or
  chance that a specific event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
  A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while a
  probability of 1 means that the event is certain to occur. A probability of
  0.5 (or 50\%) means that the event has an equal chance of occurring or not
  occurring.} and find the expected gain or cost, then combine them to calculate
the expected value\footnote{Expected value is a concept used in statistics
  to calculate the long-term average value of a random variable, taking into
  account the probability of each possible outcome.The expected value is
  calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and adding up
  all the products. In other words, it is the weighted average of all possible
  outcomes.} and understand if it is worthwhile to purchase.

These probabilities are bootstrapped\footnote{A bootstrap sample is a sample of data
  that is created by randomly selecting observations with replacement from a
  larger data set. The term ``bootstrap'' comes from the idea of pulling oneself up
  by one's bootstraps, as the bootstrap method allows us to estimate the
  properties of a population by repeatedly resampling from a smaller sample.
  To create a bootstrap sample, we start by randomly selecting an
  observation from the original data set and adding it to the new sample. We then
  put the observation back in the original data set and repeat this process,
  selecting a new observation with replacement each time, until we have a sample
  of the desired size. By selecting with replacement, some observations may be
  selected more than once, while others may not be selected at all.
  Bootstrap sampling is commonly used in statistics to estimate the sampling
  distribution of a statistic, such as the mean or variance, when the underlying
  population distribution is unknown or difficult to model. By repeatedly
  resampling from the available data, we can generate many different bootstrap
  samples and use them to estimate the variability and uncertainty of the
  statistic of interest.} through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation\footnote{A Monte
  Carlo simulation is a computational method used to estimate the probability
  distribution of an outcome by generating a large number of random samples or
  scenarios and analyzing their aggregate behavior.}.

I am first simulating the distribution of the price of the security on the
strike date using the Monte Carlo simulation. I am then able, with this
information, to obtain the probability the security will be above (below) a
certain strike and the expected value of the security if it does go above
(below) the strike for a call (put). Combining this with the cost to purchase
that derivative, I am able to create an expected value for a range of options.

\chapter{Calculating an Option's Expected Value}\label{ev}}

The expected value for each option can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
E_p(k) = (P_{ae} * C) + (P_{be} * G)
\label{eq:puts}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
E_c(k) = (P_{be} * C) + (P_{ae} * G)
\label{eq:calls}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(E_p(k)\) is the expected value of a put at strike price \(k\)
\item
  \(E_c(k)\) is the expected value of a call at strike price \(k\)
\item
  \(P_{ae}\) is the probability a security price on the strike date is above the
  \emph{effective price}\footnote{The effective price is the strike price plus the option cost
    (for calls) - you cannot make money on the option until you cross this
    threshold}, \(k_e\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation
  \item
    \(P_{ae} = \frac{r_{ae}}{r_t}\) where \(r_{ae}\) is the number of runs above
    the expected price and \(r_t\) are the total runs
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(P_{be}\) = 1 - \(P_{ae}\) is the probability a security price on the strike date
  is below the \emph{effective price}, \(k_e\)
\item
  \(C = 100c\) is the cost to buy the option

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(c\) is the cost of a single option (options are typically bought/sold in
    lots of 100)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(G = 100(E_{p_s}(p_s|p_s>k_e) - c)\) is the expected gain if the derivative
  is in the money

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(E_{p_s}(p_s|p_s>k_e)\) is the expected value of the of the price of the
    stock, \(p_s\), given that the price of the stock has exceeded the effective
    price, \(k_e\) (for calls).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction<a href="index.html#introduction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Over the course of the last year, I have developed an algorithm that calculates
the expected outcome for security<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
derivatives<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
In this paper, I am specifically
referring to put options<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and call options<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> on stocks when I reference security derivatives.
To do this, I
calculate several probabilities<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and find the expected gain or cost, then combine them to calculate
the expected value<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and understand if it is worthwhile to purchase.</p>
<p>These probabilities are bootstrapped<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I am first simulating the distribution of the price of the security on the
strike date using the Monte Carlo simulation. I am then able, with this
information, to obtain the probability the security will be above (below) a
certain strike and the expected value of the security if it does go above
(below) the strike for a call (put). Combining this with the cost to purchase
that derivative, I am able to create an expected value for a range of options.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In finance, a security refers to
a tradable financial asset that has monetary value and can be bought or sold in
a financial market. Securities include a wide range of assets, such as stocks,
bonds, options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), among others.<a href="index.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from
the value of an underlying security, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency.
<br><br>In other words, the value of a derivative depends on the value of the
underlying asset. There are many types of derivatives, including options,
futures, forwards, and swaps.<br><br>For example, an option is a type of
derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a specified time period.<a href="index.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>A put option is a type of financial contract that
gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to <em>sell</em> an underlying
security at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific
period of time (known as the strike date).<br><br>In other words, a put option
gives the holder the ability to sell an asset at a certain price, even if the market
price of the asset falls below the strike price. This can be useful for
investors who believe that the price of an asset is likely to decline, as it
allows them to profit from the decline without actually owning the asset.<br><br>
For example, if an investor buys a put option for a certain stock with a strike
price of $50 and an expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price
falls to $40 during that time, the investor can exercise the put option to sell
the stock at the higher strike price of $50, making a profit of $10 per share.
However, if the stock’s market price remains above the strike price of
$50, the investor may choose not to exercise the put option and will lose the
premium paid to purchase the option.<a href="index.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>A call option is a type
of financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to <em>buy</em> an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, at a
predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific period of
time.<br><br>In other words, a call option gives the holder the ability to
purchase an asset at a certain price, even if the market price of the asset
rises above the strike price. This can be useful for investors who believe that
the price of an asset is likely to increase, as it allows them to profit from
the increase without actually owning the asset.<br><br>For example, if an
investor buys a call option for a certain stock with a strike price of $50 and
an expiration date of one month, and the stock’s market price rises to $60
during that time, the investor can exercise the call option to buy the stock at
the lower strike price of $50, making a profit of $10 per share.<br><br>
However, if the stock’s market price remains below the strike price of $50, the
investor may choose not to exercise the call option and will lose the premium
paid to purchase the option.<a href="index.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood or
chance that a specific event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
<br><br>A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while a
probability of 1 means that the event is certain to occur. A probability of
0.5 (or 50%) means that the event has an equal chance of occurring or not
occurring.<a href="index.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Expected value is a concept used in statistics
to calculate the long-term average value of a random variable, taking into
account the probability of each possible outcome.<br><br>The expected value is
calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and adding up
all the products. In other words, it is the weighted average of all possible
outcomes.<a href="index.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>A bootstrap sample is a sample of data
that is created by randomly selecting observations with replacement from a
larger data set. The term “bootstrap” comes from the idea of pulling oneself up
by one’s bootstraps, as the bootstrap method allows us to estimate the
properties of a population by repeatedly resampling from a smaller sample.
<br><br>To create a bootstrap sample, we start by randomly selecting an
observation from the original data set and adding it to the new sample. We then
put the observation back in the original data set and repeat this process,
selecting a new observation with replacement each time, until we have a sample
of the desired size. By selecting with replacement, some observations may be
selected more than once, while others may not be selected at all.<br><br>
Bootstrap sampling is commonly used in statistics to estimate the sampling
distribution of a statistic, such as the mean or variance, when the underlying
population distribution is unknown or difficult to model. By repeatedly
resampling from the available data, we can generate many different bootstrap
samples and use them to estimate the variability and uncertainty of the
statistic of interest.<a href="index.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>A Monte
Carlo simulation is a computational method used to estimate the probability
distribution of an outcome by generating a large number of random samples or
scenarios and analyzing their aggregate behavior.<a href="index.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

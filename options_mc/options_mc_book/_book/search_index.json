[["mc.html", "3 The Monte Carlo Engine 3.1 Effective Price and Being In-The-Money", " 3 The Monte Carlo Engine I am attempting to predict what the price of any stock will be at an options expiration date, some days from now. The Monte Carlo simulation allows me to create probabilities to different scenarios. To say that more precisely, the simulation allows me to know the probability that an option will be in-the- money on its expiration date. As an example, I will predict what the price of Comcast (CMCSA) will be 30 days from now. The simulation is given all of the price change data from CMCSA back to 2000. It calculates the daily price changes. The simulation then randomly picks from the historical pot of price changes what the stock will do tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow (and so on, up to the end date 30 days from now). INSERT SINGLE PATH GRAPH HERE. This gets you a single simulated possible path that stock could take for the next 30 days. It is unlikely - probably there is actually 0% chance - that the stock will actually follow that exact random path. Here’s the magic of the simulation: I then create 100,000 more random paths using the exact same technique. INSERT FULL MC GRAPH HERE. This full world of simulated price paths allows me to see the distribution of potential prices at the option expiration date. I now know the average, median, high, low, etc. price at the expiration date. More beautifully, I can calculate probabilities that a stock price will reach or exceed a strike price at a given options expiration date. 3.1 Effective Price and Being In-The-Money To find the probability that a certain option is in-the-money, we can simply count the number of simulations that finish above (below) the effective price (the strike plus the premium for the option) and divide by the total simulations - this is the beauty of the monte carlo simulations. 3.1.1 Why do we care about the effective price (instead of just Strike Price)? It is not enough to find out if an option will only go above its strike price. You have to pay to own the option… hence, you are already some money into the deal. Since you’ve already paid some money, you need to make that money back, too, to be in-the-money. When the strike is in-the-money, the premium to buy the option will be large enough to make the effective price equal to the current price. The more in-the- money, the higher the premium. When the strike is out-of-the-money, the premium will be smaller. The further out-of-the-money a strike is, the lower the premium. 3.1.2 Let’s look at an example. CMCSA is currently trading at $38.38. Let’s use a call option with a strike of $42 that has a premium of $0.05. The effective price of the option is \\(\\$42 + \\$0.05 = \\$42.05\\). What is the probability that we meet or exceed that effective price on the strike date? To find that out, we count all of the simulations that ended with a price greater than or equal to the effective price and divide that by the total count of simulations. In this case, we have 1,090 simulations that are in-the-money out of a total 10,000, or 10.90% chance that this option ends in the money. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

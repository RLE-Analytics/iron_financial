[["picking-options.html", "3 Picking Options", " 3 Picking Options Using the simulation outlined on the previous page, I then evaluate options from the companies with the highest market capitalization (definition). Simulate the expected values for all available strike prices (calls and puts) for a given options expiration date for all stocks on the list Remove any stock options that do not have a positive expected value Create a few metrics to evaluate each option Pick the “best” option for each stock with a positive expected value Evaluate the cumulative list 3.0.1 Puts symbol CP type strike ask EP Buy Llhd Blw EP EV Blw EP EV BKNG $2,696.68 put $2,690.00 $33.30 $2,656.70 45.818% $2,492.84 $5,703.70 BLK $694.03 put $695.00 $10.30 $684.70 40.971% $658.32 $472.84 UNH $504.48 put $505.00 $6.15 $498.85 42.671% $481.39 $392.40 AVGO $632.32 put $635.00 $9.80 $625.20 43.237% $603.34 $388.71 ADBE $377.55 put $380.00 $7.20 $372.80 44.739% $355.46 $377.93 INTU $442.59 put $442.50 $7.90 $434.60 39.479% $416.13 $250.96 LMT $501.41 put $502.50 $5.90 $496.60 41.176% $482.13 $248.66 COST $496.90 put $495.00 $4.80 $490.20 37.427% $475.58 $246.86 GS $333.91 put $335.00 $4.95 $330.05 42.153% $317.50 $242.50 NVDA $276.67 put $275.00 $6.30 $268.70 37.968% $252.60 $220.63 3.0.2 Calls symbol CP type strike ask EP Buy Llhd Abv EP EV Abv EP EV BKNG $2,696.68 call $2,750.00 $19.40 $2,769.40 32.231% $2,913.99 $3,345.41 BLK $694.03 call $710.00 $4.00 $714.00 25.740% $737.09 $297.17 UNH $504.48 call $512.50 $3.15 $515.65 27.802% $530.96 $198.31 COST $496.90 call $505.00 $2.45 $507.45 27.787% $520.64 $189.68 ADBE $377.55 call $385.00 $3.25 $388.25 27.930% $403.27 $185.35 AVGO $632.32 call $650.00 $2.75 $652.75 20.816% $671.18 $165.85 GS $333.91 call $340.00 $2.55 $342.55 27.829% $353.84 $130.12 NVDA $276.67 call $290.00 $2.54 $292.54 21.786% $307.41 $125.21 LMT $501.41 call $515.00 $1.40 $516.40 19.556% $528.41 $122.26 CRM $198.50 call $202.50 $1.74 $204.24 29.264% $212.51 $118.84 I want the most bang for my buck, though.

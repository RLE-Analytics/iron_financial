The Monte Carlo simulation allows me to create probabilities for different scenarios. To say that more precisely, the simulation allows me to know the probability that an option will be in-the-money on its expiration date. As an example, I will predict what the price of Comcast (CMCSA) will be 30 days from now. The simulation is given all of the price change data from CMCSA back to 2000. It calculates the daily price changes. The simulation then randomly picks from the historical pot of price changes what the stock will do tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow (and so on, up to the end date 30 days from now). This gets you a single simulated possible path that the stock could take for the next 30 days. It is unlikely - probably there is actually 0% chance - that the stock will actually follow that exact random path. Here’s the magic of the simulation: I then create 10,000 to 100,000 more random paths using the exact same technique. This full world of simulated price paths allows me to see the distribution of potential prices at the option expiration date. I now know the average, median, high, low, etc. price at the expiration date. More beautifully, I can calculate probabilities that a stock price will reach or exceed a strike price at a given options expiration date (more on that below). 3.1 Effective Price and Being In-The-Money To find the probability that a certain option is in-the-money, we can simply count the number of simulations that finish above (or below for a put) the effective price (the strike plus the premium for the option) and divide by the total simulations - this is the beauty of the monte carlo simulations. 3.1.1 Why do we care about the effective price (instead of just Strike Price)? It is not enough to find out if an option will only go above its strike price. You have to pay to own the option… hence, you are already some money into the deal. Since you’ve already paid some money, you need to make that money back, too, to be in-the-money. When the strike is in-the-money, the premium to buy the option will be large enough to make the effective price equal to the current price. The more in-the-money, the higher the premium. When the strike is out-of-the-money, the premium will be smaller. The further out-of-the-money a strike is, the lower the premium. 3.1.2 Let’s look at an example. CMCSA is currently trading at $38.05. Let’s use a call option with a strike of $42 that has a premium of $0.05. The effective price of the option (for a call) is: $42 + $0.05 = $42.05. What is the probability that we meet or exceed that effective price on the strike date? To find that out, we count the number of all of the simulations that ended with a price greater than or equal to the effective price and divide that by the total count of simulations. In this case, we have 944 simulations that are in-the-money out of a total 10,000, or 9.44% chance that this option ends in the money. 3.2 Expected Stock Price if In-The-Money Now that I know the probability of it going above the effective price, I need to calculate the expected price of the stock if it is in-the-money. To do this, I simply take all simulations that end at or above the effective price and calculate the expected value (or mean). 3.3 Bringing it all Together: Expected Value of the Option I have the probability the option will end in-the-money (and by definition the probability that the option will end out-of-the-money). I also know the premium to buy the option and the expected price of the stock if it is above the effective price. I am ready to calculate the expected value of the option. It costs $5 to buy the option (100 shares at $0.05 each) There is a 9.44% chance the option ends in-the-money There is a 90.56% chance the option ends out-of-the-money If the option ends in the money, the stock is expected to be at $43.89, which is equivalent to a gain of $43.89 - $42.05, or $1.84 (times 100 shares) The gain if the option ends in the money is $184.35 The final gain, minus the $5 to buy the option in the first place, is $179.35 Putting all of that together, buying this option is worth $12.40 There is a 9% chance you make $179.35 There is also a 91% chance you just lose your $5 premium This expected value is really only possible if you execute this plan many many independent times over the long run "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

# The Business Plan

What if I had $10MM? How would I use it? 

Part of the money goes to making recurring bets on options - that's where the 
big break comes from. I can't put all my eggs in that basket, though... that's 
dumb. So to round things out, part of the unused cash should go into short 
term investments: a mixture of high yield savings accounts, money market 
accounts, and CDs. I can also stash some cash in stock index funds and bond 
index funds.

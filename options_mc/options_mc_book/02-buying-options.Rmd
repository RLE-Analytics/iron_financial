# Picking Options

Using the simulation outlined on the previous page, I then evaluate options 
from the companies with the highest market capitalization (definition). 

1. Simulate the expected values for all available strike prices (calls and puts) 
for a given options expiration date for all stocks on the list
2. Remove any stock options that do not have a positive expected value
3. Create a few metrics to evaluate each option
4. Pick the "best" option for each stock with a positive expected value
5. Evaluate the cumulative list

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)

dis_puts <- read_csv("../dis_puts.csv") %>% 
    mutate(CP = dollar(CP),
           strike = dollar(strike),
           ask = dollar(ask),
           `EP Buy` = dollar(`EP Buy`),
           `Llhd Blw EP` = percent(`Llhd Blw EP`),
           `EV Blw EP` = dollar(`EV Blw EP`),
           EV = dollar(EV))

dis_puts %>% 
    kbl() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

dis_calls <- read_csv("../dis_calls.csv") %>% 
    mutate(CP = dollar(CP),
           strike = dollar(strike),
           ask = dollar(ask),
           `EP Buy` = dollar(`EP Buy`),
           `Llhd Abv EP` = percent(`Llhd Abv EP`),
           `EV Abv EP` = dollar(`EV Abv EP`),
           EV = dollar(EV))

dis_calls %>% 
    kbl() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

I want the most bang for my buck, though. So I created a metric to find out 
which options had the biggest differential between cost and expected value.

















One thing to consider is the correlation between the stocks.

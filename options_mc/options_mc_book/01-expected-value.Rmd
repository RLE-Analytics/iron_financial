# Calculating Expected Value {#ev}

The expected value for each security derivative can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation} 

  E_p(k) = (P_{ae} * C) + (P_{be} * G)
  (\#eq:puts)

\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 

  E_c(k) = (P_{be} * C) + (P_{ae} * G)
  (\#eq:calls)

\end{equation} 

where  

- $E_p(k)$ is the expected value of a put at strike price $k$
- $E_c(k)$ is the expected value of a call at strike price $k$
- $P_{ae}$ is the probability a security price on the strike date is above the 
_expected price_
- $P_{be}$ is the probability a security price on the strike date is below the 
_expected price_
- $C$ is the cost to but the derivative
- $G$ is the expected gain if the derivative is in the money
